            Mohan Bhargava is a non-resident Indian who works as a Project Manager on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) program at NASA in the United States. 
            Mohan moved to the U.S. for college studies and kept on living there after his parents in India died in a car accident. 
            He keeps worrying about Kaveri Amma, a nanny at his home in Uttar Pradesh who looked after him during his childhood days. 
            After his parents' death, Kaveri Amma went to live in an old age home in Delhi and eventually lost contact with Mohan.

            Mohan wishes to go to India and bring Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S. Due to the recent success of Phase I of his project, he takes a few weeks off and travels to India. 
            He goes to the old age home but learns that Kaveri Amma no longer lives there and went to a village named Charanpur a year ago. 
            Mohan then decides to travel to Charanpur, in Uttar Pradesh.
